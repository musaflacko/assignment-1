# Assignment 1
This is a simple portfolio about myself.<br />
A chance for you to know more about me.

# Design Process
For this website, the design seems simple yet it is effective in achieving its goal.<br />
To let people know more about me in its simplest way. Mostly, images and boxes are used as a design of the website and<br /> 
there is not much text available in my portfolio.<br />
A website where potential companies or professionals could reach out to me for a future career.

Feature 3 - Contact form<br />

# Technologies Used 
- Header<br />
This is to indicate the title of the website. In this case, I have included my full name as a headstart.<br /><br />
- Flexbox<br />
This is to arrange contents of the website. In a way, it makes the design of the website neater.<br /><br />

This is a form for any additional feedbacks. It helps people to reach out to me if they need so.
